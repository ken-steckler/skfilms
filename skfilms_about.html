      <p> My name is Ken, I am a licensed pharmacist, photographer and aspiring software engineer/web developer
        in the Pacific Northwest.

      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>I like shooting photographs during my free time. I shoot a lot of landscape but I am getting into portrait photography landscape
        hope that one day I can have a side business. I'm also getting into film, which I discovered in May 2020. My first film camera was
        the Ricoh FF3-AF SUPER. Why did I choose this camera? Honestly, because it was a cheap point and shoot and it seemed like a great
        entry-level film camera for a beginner like myself. When I got my first roll developed that's when I discovered my passion for film.
        I eventually invested in a more advanced point and shoot and purchased the Contax T2, as a graduation present to myself after graduating
        pharmacy school. Now, I carry it around to almost everywhere I go, unless I'm going to work of course. I'm hoping to save enough to
        be able to afford a medium-format camera. I'm looking at the Mamiya7 or Makina67 for now but I might end up going for something else.</p>

      <h2>My Journey to Software Engineering and Web Development</h2>
      <p id="entry">Entry: February 8, 2021</p>
      <p> Shifting the focus a little bit now into why I made this website. I wanted to create my own website from scratch using what I learned
        during my journey to become a software engineer/web developer. This is my first web-based project and I plan to expand on it regularly.
        The reason why I decided to pursue this path was because I love programming and design. When I became a pharmacist, I realized that
        this career wasn't really for me. Even though it took me 10 years of school and 6-figure debt to realize this, I wanted to do something
        that I truly enjoy and love doing. I started looking at different career fields and remembered that I used to program back in high school.
        So I went back and started programming in Java. I instantly fell in love with it again.</p>
      <p> On top of my regular full time pharmacy job, I try to spend at least one hour a day practicing and getting better. I know that the
        self-taught path is not easy and I know that I have a long road ahead. But I'm inspired about the future and I'm going to give it my all
        so that I can pursue my dreams. I want a career where I can be in the field for for the next 20-30 years and never get tired of it and I can't
        wait to see what the future has in store for me.</p>
